2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Roles

   This document uses the term "Identity Provider" to refer to the
   "OpenID Provider" in [OpenID] and the "Authorization Server" in
   [RFC6749].

   This document uses the term "Application" to refer to the "Relying
   Party" in [OpenID] and the "Client" in [RFC6749].

3.  Profile

3.1.  Network Layer Requirements

3.1.1.  Requirements for all endpoints

   To protect against network attacks, clients, authorization servers,
   and resource servers

   *  MUST only offer TLS protected endpoints and MUST establish
      connections to other servers using TLS;

   *  MUST set up TLS connections using TLS version 1.2 or later;

   *  MUST follow the recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer
      Security in [BCP195];

   *  SHOULD use DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing attacks that can
      lead to the issuance of rogue domain-validated TLS certificates;
      and

   *  MUST perform a TLS server certificate check, as per [RFC9525].

3.1.2.  Requirements for endpoints not used by web browsers

   For server-to-server communication endpoints that are not used by web
   browsers, the following requirements apply:

   *  When using TLS 1.2, servers MUST only permit the cipher suites
      recommended in [BCP195];

   *  When using TLS 1.2, clients SHOULD only permit the cipher suites
      recommended in [BCP195].

3.1.3.  Requirements for endpoints used by web browsers

   For endpoints that are used by web browsers, the following additional
   requirements apply:

   *  Servers MUST use methods to ensure that connections cannot be
      downgraded using TLS stripping attacks.  A preloaded [preload]
      HTTP Strict Transport Security policy [RFC6797] can be used for
      this purpose.  Some top-level domains, like .bank and .insurance,
      have set such a policy and therefore protect all second-level
      domains below them.

   *  When using TLS 1.2, servers MUST only use cipher suites allowed in
      [BCP195].

   *  Servers MUST NOT support [CORS] for the authorization endpoint, as
      clients must perform an HTTP redirect rather than access this
      endpoint directly.

3.2.  Cryptography and Secrets

   The following requirements apply to cryptographic operations and
   secrets:

   *  Authorization servers, clients, and resource servers when creating
      or processing JWTs:

      -  MUST adhere to [RFC8725];

      -  MUST use PS256, ES256, or EdDSA (using the Ed25519 variant)
         algorithms; and

      -  MUST NOT use or accept the none algorithm.

   *  RSA keys MUST have a minimum length of 2048 bits.

   *  Elliptic curve keys MUST have a minimum length of 224 bits.

   *  Credentials not intended for handling by end-users (e.g., access
      tokens, refresh tokens, authorization codes, etc.)  MUST be
      created with at least 128 bits of entropy such that an attacker
      correctly guessing the value is computationally infeasible
      (Section 10.10 of [RFC6749]).

3.3.  OpenID Connect

   In the following, a profile of the following technologies is defined:

   *  OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 2
      [OpenID.Discovery]

   *  OpenID Connect Discovery [OpenID.Discovery]

   *  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749]

   *  Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) [RFC7636]

   *  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414]

   *  OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) [RFC9449]

   *  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification [RFC9207]

3.3.1.  Requirements for OpenID Providers

   OpenID Providers:

   *  MUST distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization
      endpoint) via the metadata document as specified in
      [OpenID.Discovery];

   *  MUST reject requests using the resource owner password credentials
      grant;

   *  MUST support public clients as defined in [RFC6749];

   *  MUST NOT expose open redirectors Section 4.11 of [RFC9700];

   *  MUST only accept its issuer identifier value (as defined in
      [RFC8414]) as a string in the aud claim received in client
      authentication assertions;

   *  MUST issue authorization codes with a maximum lifetime of 60
      seconds;

   *  MUST require clients to be preregistered, and MUST NOT support
      unauthenticated Dynamic Client Registration requests (see Note 1);

   *  MUST require clients to pre-register their redirect URIs

   Access Tokens issued by OpenID Providers:

   *  MUST only be used by the RP to retrieve identity claims at the
      OpenID Provider;

   *  MUST only issue sender-constrained access tokens using DPoP
      [RFC9449];

   ID Tokens issued by OpenID Providers:

   *  MUST contain the OAuth Client ID of the RP as a single audience
      value as a string (see Note 2);

   *  MUST contain the acr claim as a string that identifies the
      Authentication Context Class that the authentication performed
      satisfied, as described in Section 2 of [OpenID];

   *  MUST contain the amr claim as an array of strings indicating
      identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication
      from those registered in the IANA Authentication Method Reference
      Values registry, as described in Section 2 of [OpenID];

   *  MUST indicate the expected lifetime of the RP session in the
      session_lifetime claim in seconds (see Note 3);

   Note 1: The requirement for preregistered clients corresponds to
   Section 3.4 "Trust Agreements" of [NIST.FAL].

   Note 2: The audience value must be a single string to meet the
   audience restriction of [NIST.FAL].

   Note 3: This claim is not currently defined in OpenID Connect, and
   should be pulled out into its own spec in OpenID Core instead of
   being defined here.

   For the authorization code flow, OpenID Providers:

   *  MUST require the value of response_type described in [RFC6749] to
      be code;

   *  MUST require PKCE [RFC7636] with S256 as the code challenge method
      (see Note 1 below);

   *  MUST require an exact match of a registered redirect URI as
      described in Section 2.1 of [RFC9700];

   *  MUST issue authorization codes with a maximum lifetime of 60
      seconds;

   *  MUST support "Authorization Code Binding to DPoP Key" (as required
      by Section 10.1 of [RFC9449]);

   *  MUST return an iss parameter in the authorization response
      according to [RFC9207];

   *  MUST NOT transmit authorization responses over unencrypted network
      connections, and, to this end, MUST NOT allow redirect URIs that
      use the http scheme;

   *  MUST reject an authorization code (Section 1.3.1 of [RFC6749]) if
      it has been previously used;

   *  MUST NOT use the HTTP 307 status code when redirecting a request
      that contains user credentials to avoid forwarding the credentials
      to a third party accidentally (see Section 4.12 of [RFC9700]);

   *  SHOULD use the HTTP 303 status code when redirecting the user
      agent using status codes;

   *  MUST support nonce parameter values up to 64 characters in length,
      and MAY reject nonce values longer than 64 characters.

   Note 1: while both nonce and PKCE can provide protection from
   authorization code injection, nonce relies on the client (RP) to
   implement and enforce the check, and the IdP is unable to verify that
   it has been implemented correctly, and only stops the attack after
   tokens have already been issued.  Instead, PKCE is enforced by the
   IdP and stops the attack before tokens are issued.

3.3.2.  Requirements for OpenID Relying Parties

   OpenID Relying Parties:

   *  MUST support third-party initiated login as defined in Section 4
      of [OpenID];

   *  MUST use the authorization server's issuer identifier value (as
      defined in [RFC8414]) in the aud claim in client authentication
      assertions.  The issuer identifier value shall be sent as a string
      not as an item in an array;

   *  MUST NOT expose open redirectors (see Section 4.11 of [RFC9700]);

   *  MUST only use authorization server metadata (such as the
      authorization endpoint) retrieved from the metadata document as
      specified in [OpenID.Discovery] and [RFC8414];

   *  MUST ensure that the issuer URL used as the basis for retrieving
      the authorization server metadata is obtained from an
      authoritative source and using a secure channel, such that it
      cannot be modified by an attacker;

   *  MUST ensure that this issuer URL and the issuer value in the
      obtained metadata match;

   OpenID Relying Parties making resource requests to the OpenID
   Provider:

   *  MUST support sender-constrined access tokens using DPoP as
      described in [RFC9449];

   *  MUST support the server-provided nonce mechanism (as defined in
      Section 8 of [RFC9449]);

   *  MUST send access tokens in the HTTP header as described in
      Section 7.1 of [RFC9449];

   *  MUST support refresh tokens and their rotation;

   For the authorization code flow, Relying Parties:

   *  MUST use the authorization code grant described in [RFC6749];

   *  MUST use PKCE [RFC7636] with S256 as the code challenge method;

   *  MUST generate the PKCE challenge specifically for each
      authorization request and securely bind the challenge to the
      client and the user agent in which the flow was started;

   *  MUST check the iss parameter in the authorization response
      according to [RFC9207] to prevent mix-up attacks;

   *  SHOULD NOT use nonce parameter values longer than 64 characters;

   In addition to the ID Token validation requirements described in
   Section 3.1.37 of [OpenID], Relying Parties:

   *  MUST validate that the aud claim is a single string and matches
      the OAuth Client ID of the RP;

   *  MUST set the session lifetime of the session created to match the
      session_lifetime claim (see Note 1);

   Note 1: This claim is not currently defined in OpenID Connect, and
   should be pulled out into its own spec in OpenID Core instead of
   being defined here.
